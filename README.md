- 👋 Hi, I’m @kendall-smith
- 👀 I’m interested in how humans can generally reduce global suffering and increase well-being. So, I like to learn about existential philosophy, zoology, interpersonal connectedness, predicting societal trends, medicine, the study of change, corruption prevention, peace studies, computer science, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about computer science, orexin deficiencies, and how the semiconductor industry works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting to know you!

- ⚡ Fun fact: There is a chemical compound used to make banana flavoring. It's the same compound honey bees use as an alarm pheromone. So, never eat banana sweets near a beehive, and if you suddenly smell banana near a beehive, run!
